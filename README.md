# RGB Color Sensor

This project was completed as part of the Laboratory Practice module in the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering at the University of Moratuwa. The objective was to develop a prototype for an RGB color sensor.

## Project Overview

The project involved various technical aspects, including PCB designing using Altium, AVR C++ coding on Atmel Studio, and enclosure designing via SOLIDWORKS. The culmination of these skills resulted in the successful creation of a functional RGB color sensor prototype.

## Features

The RGB color sensor prototype offers three main operational modes:

1. **Mode 1 - Calibration:** Enables calibration of the device for accurate color detection.
2. **Mode 2 - Color Detection:** Detects colors on surfaces with precision.
3. **Mode 3 - User Input Color Values:** Works with user-defined color values for specific applications.

## Functionality

The physical prototype demonstrates exceptional accuracy in color detection, capable of recognizing a wide range of colors. Through meticulous calibration and robust design, the sensor reliably identifies colors across various surfaces.
